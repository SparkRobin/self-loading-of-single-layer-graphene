# self-loading-of-single-layer-graphene
Calculation of &lt; Mechanics of self-folding of single-layer graphene, Xianhong Meng et al 2013 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 46 055308> by Matlab

Validation works long long ago, will write comments in more detail when I have time. Noted that I calculated that the optimal parameter k1 should be 1.95, not 1.915. probability is a typo for the paper
